qjs-ws
======

## What is it? ##
**qjs-ws** is a simple way to give QuickJS
<https://bellard.org/quickjs/> WebSocket server capability.

Uses gwsocket <gwsocket http://gwsocket.io/> and
utf.js <https://github.com/DesWurstes/utf.js>

utf.js is supplied with qjs-ws (renamed utf.mjs, and exports added)

gwsocket needs to be downloaded and built. gwsocket provides WebSocket
server capability to shell and scripting languages.

## TODO ##

Wrap up in module. Add WebSocket client capability.
